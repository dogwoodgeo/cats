# Cat Map 
This is a personal side project of mine whereby I map the cats I see or interact with while going about living my life.  This is meant to be a platform for me to experiments and try different things with web GIS.  For instance, I designed a custom base map using Esri's [ArcGIS Vector Tile Style Editor](https://developers.arcgis.com/vector-tile-style-editor/(modal:new)). 

 View it live [here](https://dogwoodgeo.github.io/cats/).
